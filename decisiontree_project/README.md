# Diabetes Gender Prediction using Decision Tree Classifier

This project uses a Decision Tree Classifier to predict the gender of individuals based on various features from a diabetes dataset. The model is trained on the data and evaluated on a test set, and the resulting decision tree is visualized.

## Project Overview

- **Objective**: Predict the gender (target variable) of individuals using various health-related features from a diabetes dataset.
- **Model**: Decision Tree Classifier from scikit-learn.
- **Data**: The dataset contains health-related data of individuals, with a focus on diabetes-related metrics.
- **Visualization**: The trained decision tree model is exported into a `.dot` file, which can be rendered into a graphical representation of the tree structure.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - pandas (pip install pandas)
  - scikit-learn (pip install scikit-learn)
  - graphviz (pip install grahpviz)
